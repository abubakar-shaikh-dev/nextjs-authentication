Welcome to the **Next.js Authentication** repository! This project is a Next.js web application with TypeScript that demonstrates authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and MongoDB. It's built with modern web technologies including Next.js, React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Technologies Used

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [JSON Web Tokens (JWT)](https://jwt.io/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- TypeScript

## Project Description

This project is a Next.js web application with TypeScript that focuses on demonstrating authentication using JWT and MongoDB. It uses environment variables for configuration. Before you get started, make sure to create the necessary environment variables.

## Getting Started

### 1. Create Environment Variables

Before you begin, you need to set up your environment variables:

1. `MONGODB_URI` - This is the connection URI for your MongoDB database.
2. `SECRET` - This is the secret key used for JWT token generation and verification.

### 2. Creating Accounts and Getting Environment Variables

Follow these steps to get the required environment variables:

1. Sign up or log in to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
2. Create a new cluster or use an existing one.
3. Obtain the connection URI from MongoDB Atlas.
4. Generate a secure secret key for your `SECRET` environment variable.

### 3. Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/abubakar-shaikh-dev/nextjs-authentication.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd nextjs-authentication`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

### 4. Running the Application

After installation, you can run the Next.js application:

```bash
npm run dev
```
